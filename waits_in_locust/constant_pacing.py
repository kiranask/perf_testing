ðŸ§  How Constant Pacing Works (Concept):
Letâ€™s say:

You want each iteration to take exactly 5 seconds.
Your task (e.g., HTTP request) takes 2 seconds.
Then:

Constant pacing = Run the task (2s) â†’ then wait (3s) = total 5s.
If the task takes 4s, wait = 1s.
If the task takes 6s (more than pacing target), wait = 0s (no negative wait).
