Locust - Modern Load Testing Framework
Overview
Locust is an open-source, Python-based load testing tool designed to help you measure how your system performs under heavy load. Unlike traditional load testing tools, Locust is user-friendly, scriptable, and scalable, allowing you to simulate millions of users with a distributed approach.
Key Features

Python-Based Scripting: Write test scenarios in plain Python code
Web-Based UI: Monitor tests in real-time through an intuitive dashboard
Distributed Testing: Scale across multiple machines to generate massive load
HTTP/S and Custom Protocols: Test web applications or any custom protocol
No Dependency on Web Browsers: Efficient, lightweight testing without browser overhead
Extensible Architecture: Create custom test types and extend functionality

Installation
bashCopypip install locust
Basic Usage
Creating a Locust File
Create a file named locustfile.py:
pythonCopyfrom locust import HttpUser, task, between

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)  # Wait between 1 and 5 seconds between tasks
    
    @task
    def index_page(self):
        self.client.get("/")
        
    @task(3)  # This task is 3 times more likely to be executed
    def view_products(self):
        self.client.get("/products")
Running Locust
bashCopylocust
Then open your browser to http://localhost:8089 to access the Locust web interface.
Advanced Features
Custom Load Shapes
Control how the load ramps up and down over time:
pythonCopyfrom locust import HttpUser, task, between
from locust.shape import LoadShape

class StagesShape(LoadShape):
    stages = [
        {"duration": 60, "users": 10, "spawn_rate": 10},
        {"duration": 120, "users": 50, "spawn_rate": 10},
        {"duration": 180, "users": 100, "spawn_rate": 10},
        {"duration": 240, "users": 30, "spawn_rate": 10},
        {"duration": 300, "users": 0, "spawn_rate": 10},
    ]
    
    def tick(self):
        run_time = self.get_run_time()
        
        for stage in self.stages:
            if run_time < stage["duration"]:
                return stage["users"], stage["spawn_rate"]
        
        return 0, 0

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)
    
    @task
    def index_page(self):
        self.client.get("/")
Custom Data and Dependencies
Use setup methods to prepare test data:
pythonCopyfrom locust import HttpUser, task, between

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)
    token = ""
    
    def on_start(self):
        # Login and store authentication token
        response = self.client.post("/login", json={
            "username": "test_user",
            "password": "test_password"
        })
        self.token = response.json()["token"]
    
    @task
    def protected_resource(self):
        self.client.get("/protected", headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.token}"
        })
Distributed Load Testing
Run Locust in distributed mode with multiple worker nodes:

Start the master:

bashCopylocust --master

Start workers on other machines:

bashCopylocust --worker --master-host=192.168.0.10
Best Practices

Start Small: Begin with a small number of users and gradually increase
Monitor System Resources: Watch CPU, memory, and network on both the testing machines and targets
Realistic Scenarios: Model real user behavior with appropriate wait times and task weights
Use Think Time: Include realistic pauses between actions with wait_time
Separate Test Data: Use different test data sets to avoid caching effects
Include Assertions: Check responses for validity, not just performance
Target Specific Endpoints: Focus on critical paths and potential bottlenecks

Common Issues and Solutions
High CPU Usage on Test Machines
If your test machines are hitting CPU limits before your system under test:

Distribute tests across more machines
Optimize your test scripts
Consider using gevent for more efficient concurrency

Connection Errors
If you're seeing many connection errors:

Check system ulimits on the test machines
Adjust network timeouts
Verify firewall settings

Memory Leaks
If memory usage keeps growing:

Check for resources not being released in your test code
Ensure proper cleanup in on_stop methods
Use a smaller number of users per worker

Integration with CI/CD
Run Locust headlessly for CI/CD pipelines:
bashCopylocust -f locustfile.py --headless -u 100 -r 10 --run-time 5m --host https://example.com
Exit with non-zero code if performance thresholds are exceeded:
bashCopylocust -f locustfile.py --headless -u 100 -r 10 --run-time 5m --host https://example.com --stop-timeout 10 --expect-slaves 2 --csv=results --html=report.html
